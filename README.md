# Memory Game

For this project, you’ll be building a **Memory Game** in the browser using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal is to create an interactive card-based memory game.

Players will be presented with a collection of face-down cards. Clicking on a card reveals its content. The objective is to match all pairs correctly.

## 🎯 Features

- **Flip Cards** - Click to reveal a card's content.
- **Match Check** - If two selected cards match, they remain revealed.
- **Mismatch Delay** - If two cards don’t match, they flip back after a second.
- **Score Tracker** - Counts the number of attempts made.
- **Restart Button** - Allows users to reset the game.
- **Best Score Storage** - Stores the lowest number of attempts in local storage.
